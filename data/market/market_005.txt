Market Intelligence: Alzheimer's Disease Modifying Therapy Market Launch Challenges

Date: November 2024

Market Context: Anti-amyloid antibodies represent first disease-modifying therapies but face unprecedented commercialization hurdles.

Lecanemab (Leqembi) Launch Status:
- Biogen/Eisai pricing: $26,500/year
- Uptake slower than expected: $500M 2024 (vs $1B forecast)
- Infrastructure gap: ARIA monitoring requires specialized MRI capacity

Access Challenges:
- CMS coverage with evidence development (CED) limits access
- Amyloid PET or CSF biomarker confirmation required
- APOE4 genotyping complicating patient selection

Healthcare System Readiness:
- Infusion center capacity constraints
- Neurologist shortage for ARIA monitoring
- Patient identification in primary care limited

Donanemab Outlook:
- Lilly pricing expected similar to Leqembi
- Dosing advantage: Potential to stop after amyloid clearance
- FDA approval expected late 2024

Investment Signal: LONG-TERM POSITIVE but near-term challenges significant. Healthcare infrastructure investment required for market realization. Watch for diagnostic simplification technologies.
