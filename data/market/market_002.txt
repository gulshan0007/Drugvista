Market Intelligence: Cell and Gene Therapy Market Faces Reimbursement Reality Check

Date: October 2024

Market Overview: Cell and gene therapy market valued at $12 billion in 2024, but growth slower than projected due to commercial challenges.

Pricing Pressures:
- Zolgensma ($2.1M): Novartis reports declining new patient starts
- Bluebird Bio: Exited European market due to pricing negotiations
- Sarepta's Elevidys ($3.2M): Limited uptake despite approval

Reimbursement Models:
- Outcomes-based agreements gaining traction
- CMS exploring cell/gene therapy payment models
- Medicaid programs struggling with budget impact

Manufacturing Challenges:
- Autologous therapies: 3-4 week vein-to-vein time
- 10-15% manufacturing failure rates
- Quality control remains labor-intensive

Strategic Shifts:
- Companies pivoting to allogeneic (off-the-shelf) approaches
- In-vivo gene therapy reducing manufacturing complexity
- CRISPR companies positioning for lower-cost delivery

Investment Signal: CAUTIOUS. High scientific promise but commercial execution remains challenging. Focus on companies with strong manufacturing capabilities.
