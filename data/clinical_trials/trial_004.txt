Trial: TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 - Donanemab in Early Symptomatic Alzheimer's

Sponsor: Eli Lilly
Enrollment: 1,736 patients
Duration: 76 weeks
Population: Early symptomatic Alzheimer's with amyloid and tau pathology

Primary Endpoint: Change in integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS)

Results:
- Donanemab slowed decline by 35% vs placebo on iADRS (p<0.001)
- CDR-SB decline slowed by 36%
- 47% of patients achieved amyloid clearance by 6 months
- 52% discontinued treatment after achieving amyloid clearance

Safety Concerns:
- ARIA-E (edema): 24% (symptomatic in 6%)
- ARIA-H (microhemorrhages): 31%
- Three deaths possibly treatment-related
- APOE4 homozygotes at highest ARIA risk

Conclusion: Demonstrates clinical benefit of amyloid clearance but safety concerns require careful patient selection. Expected FDA decision in 2024. Contraindicated with anticoagulants.
