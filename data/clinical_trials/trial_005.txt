Trial: EMBARK - Gene Therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

Sponsor: Sarepta Therapeutics
Enrollment: 126 patients (ages 4-7)
Duration: 52 weeks primary, ongoing long-term
Population: Ambulatory boys with DMD, any dystrophin mutation

Primary Endpoint: North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) change

Preliminary Results:
- NSAA improvement: +2.6 points vs +0.9 placebo at 52 weeks (p<0.001)
- Time to rise improvement: -1.3 seconds vs -0.2 placebo
- Micro-dystrophin expression: 54% of normal at muscle biopsy

Safety:
- Immune-mediated myositis in 3 patients (treated with steroids)
- Liver enzyme elevations (transient, resolved)
- Vomiting (32%), pyrexia (27%)
- One patient death from cardiac adverse event (under investigation)

Conclusion: First gene therapy showing functional improvement in DMD. FDA accelerated approval granted June 2023. Long-term durability and safety data critical for full approval pathway. Cost approximately $3.2 million per treatment.
